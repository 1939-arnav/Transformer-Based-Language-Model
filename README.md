#  Transformer Script Writing Assistant

A PyTorch-based Transformer model trained on Shakespearean text to generate stylized dialogue for creative writing, theatrical scripts, or educational tools.

This project implements a custom Transformer-based language model trained on Shakespearean text to generate stylized dialogue and monologues.

The goal is to explore how attention-based architectures can be used for creative writing tasks, specifically for assisting in **script writing**. The model is built from scratch using PyTorch and employs subword-level tokenization (Byte-Pair Encoding) to efficiently learn language structure from a small dataset.

It can generate fluent, dramatic-style text — mimicking Shakespearean language — and showcases how language models can serve as tools for writers, playwrights, or educators.

- Subword-level tokenization using Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)
- Trained on the Tiny Shakespeare corpus
- Generates stylized text in Shakespearean form
- Includes both a clean script and full notebook with theory and experimentation
